# Pediatric Sepsis Mortality Prediction

We are developing random forest and logistic regression models to predict sepsis within 4 hours of ER admission. 
We are identifying feature groups that are the most important drivers of predction using Shapley values. 
Additionally, we are creating additional age-adjusted features for better model explanability.
